Java solution architecture, a CTO once asked me: 
&lt;em&gt;"Yeah, we've got this 2 GB EAR with 400+ WAR deployments inside. 
So what's the problem? The system still is completely functional!"&lt;/em&gt;. 
My instant feeling was 
&lt;em&gt;"Ok, this CTO himself is a much bigger problem than this EAR!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
