I decided to have my own one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably because I'm not comfortable to write in english, 
or only laziness I spent most of my time sharing my experience by voice with friends, 
colleagues and coders around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway as I have been able to work in four continents, 
probably people take care more what I can say and less in my ability to 
manage English language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I have more free time and desire to share, so I started my personal blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Stefano Apostolico</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:stefanoapostolico.com,2014-11-22:2014/11/22/start-blogging.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
