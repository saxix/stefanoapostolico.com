Title: Start blogging

After years spent to coding and getting benefits from someone else blog,
I decided to have my own one.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Probably because I'm not comfortable to write in english, 
or only laziness I spent most of my time sharing my experience by voice with friends, 
colleagues and coders around the world.

Anyway as I have been able to work in four continents, 
probably people take care more what I can say and less in my ability to 
manage English language.

Today I have more free time and desire to share, so I started my personal blog.
