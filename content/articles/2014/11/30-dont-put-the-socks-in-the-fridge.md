Title: Don't put the socks in the fridge

Once a CTO asked:
*"Why 2Gb ear with more than 400 war inside is a problem? The system is working."*
my thought was *"Ok the problem is the CTO"*

 
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->



A few years ago, I was in India to train developers of a local IT company.
It was a great experience and I found al lot of wonderful person there, 
I'm still in touch with some of them.
They were good developers, hard workers with a hunger to learn more and 
deepen any topic.
One day, to explain some design principles, I told them 
"Don't put the socks in the fridge", my intent was to explain that when you 
design there is a place for everything, and sometimes it's not needed a written 
rule or law to feel that something is wrong. 
(High Cohesion, Least Surprise, Common Sense, Cleanness)

The sentence came up in my mind during the conversation and they immediately 
understood the principle without any needs to further examples.

At that time I could not imagine how many times I would have to use this example 

Over the years I found it very frustrating meet people who claimed to be technical 
or even architects who argue that "is not 'wrong to use SQL mixed to HTML" 
or "there is no problem to use spaces in the dictionary keys for a REST API "

Try to explain why there is no need to have a rule for everything, 
and there are a lot of risks in doing so, produced only endless discussions 
without any results.

If you fall in this kind of discussion, you must stop as soon as you can, because 
the problem is not the matter of the discussion, but in the technical gap between 
the interlocutors.

If you find yourself to explain something widely shared between the community 
and/or the technicians (and you relly know that and the reason of that)
to someone that only reply "Why ?", "Where is the rule ?"
leave the discussion as soon as possible, there is no way to get out of it
